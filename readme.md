## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/techo-anant/JobEazy.git
    cd JobEazy
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install 
    ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ../jobeazy
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

1.	Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```

2.	In a separate terminal, start the frontend application:

    ```bash
    cd ../jobeazy
    ng serve
    ```

3.	Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to access the application.

## üìå Notes
The backend uses a local JSON file (applications.json) to store application data. This setup is suitable for development and testing purposes. For production environments, consider integrating a database system.

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the frontend, providing a utility-first approach to design.
